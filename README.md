## GROUP- I can do it - lab 1 - variant 4  Set based on hash-map (collision resolution: separate chaining)

## Project structure

- `mutable.py` -- implementation of `HashMap` class with `add` and `remove` and
   `size` and `key_number` and `is_member` and
   `from_list` and `to_list` and `filter` and
   `map` and `reduce` and `monoid_add` and `iteration` features.
   
- `test_mutable.py` -- unit and PBT tests for `mutable`.

## Features

- PBT: `test_from_list_to_list_equality`
- and  `test_python_len_and_list_size_equality`
- and `test_monoid_add` and `test_iter`

## Contribution

- Yu Jiakai(212320029@hdu.edu.cn) -- completed  basic operations.
- Kang Jiale(212320026@hdu.edu.cn) -- fix Bugs and test.

## Design notes

-   In this lab work, We have completed some basic operations on the dictionary structure.
    These operations about: add, remove,size,key_number,is_member, to_list,from_list,filter,map,reduce,__iter__,__next__ and monoid_add .
    Our code has been committed into the github [https://github.com/yujiakai8888/gitrespo](https://github.com/yujiakai8888/CPO_LAB1/)
